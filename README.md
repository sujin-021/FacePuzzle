### Overview
This is a sliding puzzle used photo tiles. As the puzzle pieces move, black-and-white portrait reveal vibrant, colorful fragments â€” giving the impression of color to a faded photo.


### Technologies Used
- Java (Processing)


### System Features 
- Puzzle Mechanics : classic 3x3 sliding puzzle with one empty tile. Tiles are moved by checking whether the clicked tile is adjacent to the empty space. If so, their positions are swapped.

- Visual : Puzzle tiles are filled with randomized colored photo pieces. Each tile image is randomly chosen from colored variations(red3.jpg, green5.jpg, etc.). This visual juxtaposition metaphorically suggests "bringing color back to the face".

- Particle-Based Text : Custom shapes for each letter are filled with randomly placed ellipse() particles using rectangular or quadrilateral bounds.
